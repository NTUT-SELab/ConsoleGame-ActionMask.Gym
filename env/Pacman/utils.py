    A counter keeps track of counts for a set of keys.
    The counter class is an extension of the standard python
    dictionary type.  It is specialized to have number values
    (integers or floats), and includes a handful of additional
    functions to ease the task of counting data.  In particular,
    all keys are defaulted to have value 0.  Using a dictionary:
    a = {}
    print a['test']
    would give an error, while the Counter class analogue:
    >>> a = Counter()
    >>> print a['test']
    0
    returns the default 0 value. Note that to reference a key
    that you know is contained in the counter,
    you can still use the dictionary syntax:
    >>> a = Counter()
    >>> a['test'] = 2
    >>> print a['test']
    2
    This is very useful for counting things without initializing their counts,
    see for example:
    >>> a['blah'] += 1
    >>> print a['blah']
    1
    The counter also includes additional functionality useful in implementing
    the classifiers for this assignment.  Two counters can be added,
    subtracted or multiplied together.  See below for details.  They can
    also be normalized and their total count and arg max can be extracted.
